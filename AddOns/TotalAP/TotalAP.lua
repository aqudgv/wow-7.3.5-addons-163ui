-- Libraries
local Addon = LibStub("AceAddon-3.0"):NewAddon("TotalAP", "AceConsole-3.0", "AceEvent-3.0"); -- AceAddon object -> local because it's not really needed elsewhere
--local SharedMedia = LibStub("LibSharedMedia-3.0");  -- TODO: Not implemented yet... But "soon" (TM) -> allow styling of bars and font strings (I'm really just waiting until the config/options are done properly for this -> AceConfig)
local Masque = LibStub("Masque", true); -- optional (will use default client style if not found)


local addonName, T = ...
if not T then return end


TotalAP = T -- Make modules available globally (for keybinds, mainly, which don't seem to have access to the addon table (TODO: Check if this is actually true - lazy me, I know)
local TotalAP = TotalAP -- ... but use local copy to avoid lookups in global environment
local L = T.L -- Localization table
T.Addon = Addon -- to allow access to AceDB methods
T.Masque = Masque -- to allow buttons to register and update themselves more easily


-- One-time checks (per login... not stored otherwise)
local specIgnoredWarningGiven = false 


local settings = {} --  (TODO: Remove this, as it's not really needed after the GUI rework)


-- Standard methods (via AceAddon) -> They use the local object and not the shared container variable (which are for the modularised functions in other lua files)
-- TODO: Use AceConfig to create slash commands automatically for simplicity?

function Addon:OnProfileChanged(event, database, newProfileKey)

function Addon:OnInitialize() -- Called on ADDON_LOADED
	
	-- Initialise settings (saved variables), handled via AceDB
	TotalAP.Settings.Initialise()

	-- Make sure at least one View is usable (TODO: Pointless for now; Always prepares the DefaultView, as others aren't implemented yet)
	TotalAP.Controllers.InitialiseGUI()
	
	-- TODO: via AceGUI?
	-- TODO: Allow custom views to be loaded instead of (or in addition to) the default one, and toggling of views, respectively

	-- Register slash commands
	self:RegisterChatCommand(TotalAP.Controllers.GetSlashCommand(), TotalAP.Controllers.SlashCommandHandler)
	self:RegisterChatCommand(TotalAP.Controllers.GetSlashCommandAlias(), TotalAP.Controllers.SlashCommandHandler_UsedAlias) -- alias is /ap instead of /totalap - with the latter providing a fallback mechanism in case some other addon chose to use /ap as well or for lazy people (like me)
	
	-- Add keybinds to Blizzard's KeybindUI
	TotalAP.Controllers.RegisterKeybinds()
	
	-- Hook script handler to display tooltip additions when hovering over an AP item (and the action button itself) - TODO: Global handling of script handlers somewhere else, including those that are used as part of the GUI?
	GameTooltip:HookScript('OnTooltipSetItem', TotalAP.GUI.Tooltips.ShowActionButtonTooltip)
